Water for future

Elevator Pitch
Do you know that today, 700 million people are water scarce and this number will go to 1.8 billion in 10 years!
We came up with a solution based on modern technologies which not only create water resources but also tackle the upcoming world threat of water crisis.

Since, it's a mechanical device, no coding was required.
Thank you.
